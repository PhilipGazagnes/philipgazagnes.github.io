    <h1>Cranberries - Zombie</h1>
    <div>
      <p>Another head hangs lowly</p>
      <p>Child is slowly taken</p>
      <p>And the violence, caused such silence</p>
      <p>Who are we mistaken?</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>But you see, it's not me</p>
      <p>It's not my family</p>
      <p>In your head, in your head, they are fighting</p>
      <p>With their tanks, and their bombs</p>
      <p>And their bombs, and their guns</p>
      <p>In your head, in your head they are crying</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>In your head, in your head</p>
      <p>Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie</p>
      <p>What's in your head, in your head</p>
      <p>Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Du, du, du, du</p>
      <p>Du, du, du, du</p>
      <p>Du, du, du, du</p>
      <p>Du, du, du, du</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Another mother's breaking</p>
      <p>Heart is taking over</p>
      <p>When the violence causes silence</p>
      <p>We must be mistaken</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>It's the same old theme</p>
      <p>Since nineteen-sixteen</p>
      <p>In your head, in your head, they're still fighting</p>
      <p>With their tanks, and their bombs</p>
      <p>And their bombs, and their guns</p>
      <p>In your head, in your head, they are dying</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>In your head, in your head</p>
      <p>Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie</p>
      <p>What's in your head, in your head</p>
      <p>Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ie-ie oh</p>
    </div>
