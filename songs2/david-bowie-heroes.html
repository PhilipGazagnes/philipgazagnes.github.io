    <h1>David Bowie - Heroes</h1>
    <div>
      <p>I, I will be king</p>
      <p>And you, you will be queen</p>
      <p>Though nothing will drive them away</p>
      <p>We can beat them, just for one day</p>
      <p>We can be Heroes, just for one day</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>And you, you can be mean</p>
      <p>And I, I'll drink all the time</p>
      <p>'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact</p>
      <p>Yes we're lovers, and that is that</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Though nothing, will keep us together</p>
      <p>We could steal time, just for one day</p>
      <p>We can be Heroes, for ever and ever</p>
      <p>What'd you say?</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>I, I wish you could swim</p>
      <p>Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim</p>
      <p>Though nothing</p>
      <p>Nothing will keep us together</p>
      <p>We can beat them, for ever and ever</p>
      <p>Oh we can be Heroes, just for one day</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>I, I will be king</p>
      <p>And you, you will be queen</p>
      <p>Though nothing will drive them away</p>
      <p>We can be Heroes</p>
      <p>Just for one day</p>
      <p>We can be all us</p>
      <p>Just for one day</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>I, I can remember (I remember)</p>
      <p>Standing by the wall (By the wall)</p>
      <p>And the guns shot above our heads (Over our heads)</p>
      <p>And we kissed as though nothing could fall (Nothing could fall)</p>
      <p>And the shame</p>
      <p>Was on the other side</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Oh we can beat them</p>
      <p>For ever and ever</p>
      <p>Then we could be Heros</p>
      <p>Just for one day</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>We can be Heroes</p>
      <p>We can be Heroes</p>
      <p>We can be Heroes</p>
      <p>Just for one day</p>
      <p>We can be Heroes</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>We're nothing</p>
      <p>And nothing will help us</p>
      <p>Maybe we're lying</p>
      <p>Then you better not stay</p>
      <p>But we could be safer</p>
      <p>Just for one day</p>
      <p>Oh-oh-oh-ohh</p>
      <p>Oh-oh-oh-ohh</p>
      <p>Just for one day</p>
