Aaahh freak out!
Le freak, see'est Chic
Freak out!
Aaahh freak out!
Le freak, see'est Chic
Freak out!

Have you heard about the new dance craze?
Listen to us, I'm sure you'll be amazed
Big fun to be had by everyone
It's up to you, it surely can be done
Young and old are doing it, I'm told
Just one try, and you too will be sold
It's called Le Freak! They're doing it night and day
Allow us, we'll show you the way

Aaahh freak out!
Le freak, see'est Chic
Freak out!

All that pressure got you down
Has your head spinning all around
Feel the rhythm, check the rhyme
Come on along and have a real good time
Like the days of stopping at the Savoy
Now we freak, oh what a joy
Just come on down, to fifty four
Find a spot out on the floor

Aaahh freak out!
Le freak, see'est Chic
Freak out!

Now freak!
I said freak!
Now freak!

All that pressure got you down
Has your head spinning all around
Feel the rhythm, check the ride
Come on along and have a real good time
Like the days of stopping at the Savoy
Now they freak, oh what a joy
Just come on down, to fifty four
Find a spot out on the floor

Aaahh freak out!
Le freak, see'est Chic
Freak out!
Aaahh freak out!
Le freak, see'est Chic
Freak out!
Aaahh freak out!
