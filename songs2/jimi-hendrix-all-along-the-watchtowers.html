    <h1>Jimi Hendrix - all along the watchtowers</h1>
    <div>
      <p>"There must be some kind of way out of here,"</p>
      <p>Said the joker to the thief</p>
      <p>"There's too much confusion</p>
      <p>I can't get no relief.</p>
      <p>Businessmen, they drink my wine</p>
      <p>Plowmen dig my earth</p>
      <p>None of them along the line</p>
      <p>Know what any of it is worth."</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>"No reason to get excited,"</p>
      <p>The thief, he kindly spoke.</p>
      <p>"There are many here among us</p>
      <p>Who feel that life is but a joke.</p>
      <p>But you and I, we've been through that</p>
      <p>And this is not our fate</p>
      <p>So let us not talk falsely now</p>
      <p>The hour's getting late."</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>All along the watchtower</p>
      <p>Princes kept the view</p>
      <p>While all the women came and went</p>
      <p>Barefoot servants too</p>
      <p>Outside in the cold distance</p>
      <p>A wild cat did growl</p>
      <p>Two riders were approaching</p>
      <p>And the wind began to howl</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>All along the watchtower</p>
      <p>All along the watchtower</p>
    </div>
