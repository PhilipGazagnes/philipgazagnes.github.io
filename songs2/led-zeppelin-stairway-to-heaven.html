    <h1>led zep - stairway to heaven</h1>
    <div>
      <p>There's a lady who's sure</p>
      <p>All that glitters is gold</p>
      <p>And she's buying a stairway</p>
      <p>To heaven</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>When she gets there she knows</p>
      <p>If the stores are all closed</p>
      <p>With a word she can get</p>
      <p>What she came for</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>And she's buying a stairway to heaven</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>There's a sign on the wall</p>
      <p>But she wants to be sure</p>
      <p>'Cause you know sometimes</p>
      <p>Words have two meanings</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>In a tree by the brook</p>
      <p>There's a songbird who sings</p>
      <p>Sometimes all of our thoughts</p>
      <p>Are misgiven</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Ooh, it makes me wonder</p>
      <p>Ooh, it makes me wonder</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>There's a feeling I get</p>
      <p>When I look to the west</p>
      <p>And my spirit is crying</p>
      <p>For leaving</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>In my thoughts I have seen</p>
      <p>Rings of smoke through the trees</p>
      <p>And the voices of those</p>
      <p>Who stand looking</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Ooh, it makes me wonder</p>
      <p>Ooh, it really makes me wonder</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>And it's whispered that soon</p>
      <p>If we all call the tune</p>
      <p>Then the piper will</p>
      <p>Lead us to reason</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>And a new day will dawn</p>
      <p>For those who stand long</p>
      <p>And the forests will echo</p>
      <p>With laughter</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>If there's a bustle in your hedgerow</p>
      <p>Don't be alarmed now</p>
      <p>It's just a spring clean for the May Queen</p>
      <p>Yes, there are two paths you can go by</p>
      <p>But in the long run</p>
      <p>And there's still time to change the road you're on</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>And it makes me wonder</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Your head is humming and it won't go</p>
      <p>In case you don't know</p>
      <p>The piper's calling you to join him</p>
      <p>Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow</p>
      <p>And did you know</p>
      <p>Your stairway lies on the whispering wind</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>And as we wind on down the road</p>
      <p>Our shadows taller than our soul</p>
      <p>There walks a lady we all know</p>
      <p>Who shines white light and wants to show</p>
      <p>How everything still turns to gold</p>
      <p>And if you listen very hard</p>
      <p>The tune will come to you at last</p>
      <p>When all are one and one is all, yeah</p>
      <p>To be a rock and not to roll</p>
    </div>
  </body>
