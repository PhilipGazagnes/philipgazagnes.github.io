Darling, you got to let me know
Should I stay or should I go?
If you say that you are mine
I'll be here 'til the end of time
So you got to let me know
Should I stay or should I go?

It's always tease, tease, tease
You're happy when I'm on my knees
One day it's fine and next it's black
So if you want me off your back
Well, come on and let me know
Should I stay or should I go?

Should I stay or should I go now?
Should I stay or should I go now?
If I go, there will be trouble
And if I stay it will be double
So come on and let me know

This indecision's bugging me (esta indecisión me molesta)
If you don't want me, set me free (si no me quieres, librarme)
Exactly whom I'm supposed to be (dígame que tengo ser)
Don't you know which clothes even fit me? (sabes que ropa me quedra)
Come on and let me know (me tienes que decir)
Should I cool it or should I blow? (me debo ir o quedarme)
