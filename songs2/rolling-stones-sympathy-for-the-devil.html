    <h1>Rolling Stones - Sympathy for the Devil</h1>
    <div>
      <p>Please allow me to introduce myself</p>
      <p>I'm a man of wealth and taste</p>
      <p>I've been around for a long, long year</p>
      <p>Stole many a man's soul to waste</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>And I was 'round when Jesus Christ</p>
      <p>Had his moment of doubt and pain</p>
      <p>Made damn sure that Pilate</p>
      <p>Washed his hands and sealed his fate</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Pleased to meet you</p>
      <p>Hope you guess my name</p>
      <p>But what's puzzling you</p>
      <p>Is the nature of my game</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>I stuck around St. Petersburg</p>
      <p>When I saw it was a time for a change</p>
      <p>Killed the czar and his ministers</p>
      <p>Anastasia screamed in vain</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>I rode a tank</p>
      <p>Held a general's rank</p>
      <p>When the blitzkrieg raged</p>
      <p>And the bodies stank</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Pleased to meet you</p>
      <p>Hope you guess my name, oh yeah</p>
      <p>Ah, what's puzzling you</p>
      <p>Is the nature of my game, oh yeah</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>I watched with glee</p>
      <p>While your kings and queens</p>
      <p>Fought for ten decades</p>
      <p>For the gods they made</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>I shouted out</p>
      <p>Who killed the Kennedys?</p>
      <p>When after all</p>
      <p>It was you and me</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Let me please introduce myself</p>
      <p>I'm a man of wealth and taste</p>
      <p>And I laid traps for troubadours</p>
      <p>Who get killed before they reached Bombay</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Pleased to meet you</p>
      <p>Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah</p>

    <div>
      <p>Pleased to meet you</p>

      <p>But what's confusing you</p>
      <p>Is just the nature of my game, mm yeah</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Just as every cop is a criminal</p>
      <p>And all the sinners saints</p>
      <p>As heads is tails</p>
      <p>Just call me Lucifer</p>
      <p>'Cause I'm in need of some restraint</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>So if you meet me</p>
      <p>Have some courtesy</p>
      <p>Have some sympathy, and some taste</p>
      <p>Use all your well-learned politesse</p>
      <p>Or I'll lay your soul to waste, mm yeah</p>
    </div>
    <div>
